In this section of the project, you will need to compute the "control bit
strings" for your microcontroller. Control bit strings will be used to decidew
which signal is high (1) for a certain state. For example, let us look as
FETCH macro state.

In FETCH you get the next instruction from memory, and put it in the IR. At the
same time, you also increment the PC. For LC 2200, this takes 3 clock cycles:
Let us look at which signals need to be high for FETCH0:
DrPC -> To drive the value of PC on to the bus
LdMar -> To load the PC value in the memory access register
LdA -> Time saving trip to load current PC into one of the ALU registers.
NEXT STATE -> FETCH1

This means that all the signals except for the above mentioned need to be low (0)

Following the schema from Appendix A of the project pdf file we come up with the
following bit string: Why?

0000010001010010000000000

which translates to the following hex value:

008A400

Now, your task is to compute the bit string for all MACRO states of each instruction
in the ISA, and convert them to hex.
For this purpose you should make a spread sheet with all the macro states, and
all the control signals. Then you should fill out the 1's and 0's for all the
control signals under a certain macro state.
